ProcessControlsTuningTool
=========================

This is a tool that I am developing that will be able to take in operating data from a process controller and allow the software user to optimize the PID control parameters. I started the project mostly for educational purposes but have found that with the right development it could be very useful :)



Info: 06/22/2013: This project is still in the prototype phase. The prototype is being written in VBA using excel as a front end. 

I am geeting close to proving out the concept at which point I will start developing a more sophisticated front end and program it using F# or python...
